**WORK IN PROGRESS**

# Introduction

Early Modern English literature represents the building block of most of the practices that we can find today in modern English literature, from the literary devices to themes, philosophical views, and even character tropes. This document serves as a quick glance over the twists and turns taken throughout history that have lead to the creation of the modern English novel, poetry, and literature as a whole. 

## John Milton

John Milton (1608 -- 1674) is one of the most substantial figures in the creation of modern English poetry.

### _Paradise Lost_

_Paradise Lost_ is an epic poem in blank verse[^blank] written by John Milton (1608 -- 1674) and publised in the year 1667. The work was originally divided into ten books, with later revisions being arranged in twelve books, as in Virgil's Aeneid, to more closely represent the model of classical epic poems. 

The poem is considered to be Milton's **magnum opus**, leading to his classification as of one of the greatest poets of English literature, commonly compared to the likes of Shakespeare. It tells the well-known Christian biblical narrative of the book of Genesis and the story of the fall of man: the temptation of Adam and Eve by Satan and subsequent knowledge of good and bad, and their expulsion from the Garden of Eden.

#### Plot and Characters

#### Major Themes

Christian and Biblical themes are abundant throughout the poem, given its plot, as well as themes related to theology, such as free will, predestination, and redemption.

## Daniel Defoe

Daniel Defoe (1660 -- 1731) was an English writer, merchant, and spy for both the Whigs and the Tories[^whigs]. His work was diverse and dynamic, from being an inventor and a bankrupt, to working as a politician, a businessman, and in journaling. His literary carreer was quite strong, having written over 250 works on a multitude of topics.

Despite being an extremely prolific writter, Defoe started his novel writing later in his life, having written his first novel, _Robinson Crusoe_, in his late fifties. Nevertheless, Defoe is best known for his novels, and is considered by many critics as _the inventor of the modern English novel_, since he was the first major English novelist to break away from the traditional formulas of literature (romances, epics, legends, allegories, and others), instead opting to write using real events as his inspiration, combining fiction with reality.

One such example of his blending of fiction and reality can be found in his first novel, which was most likely inspired by the many cases of real-life castaways, particularly the case of a Scottish sailor named [Alexander Selkirk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Selkirk), who was stranded for four years on an uninhabited island, named Robinson Crusoe Island since 1966, close to the Chilean coast.

[^whigs]: The Whigs and the Tories were two rivaling political parties in Britain between the 17th and 19th centuries.

### _Robinson Crusoe_

The first novel written by Daniel Defoe is _Robinson Crusoe_[^longtitle], published on the 25th of April 1719. It enjoyed almost immediate success and was greatly appreciated by readers for the story's verosimilitude (convincing rendition of reality) and captivating adventures. Defoe immediately followed the novel with two sequels, _The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe_, the same year, and _Serious Reflections During the Life and Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe: With his Vision of the Angelick World"_. The novel was so successful its first volume went through four editions by the end of the year, and was translated into a great number of languages (including smaller languages such as Coptic and Maltese). In fact, its legacy was so strong that the term "Robinsonade" was choosen to refer to the genre of adventure-focused stories that followed the model of _Robinson Crusoe_.

One of the novel's particularities and a characteristic feature of Daniel Defoe's novel writing, is the autobiographical narrative and usage of the story as a means to conceal a moral message. 

[^longtitle]: Or, under its full title: _"The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, of York, Mariner: Who lived Eight and Twenty Years, all alone in an un-inhabited Island on the Coast of America, near the Mouth of the Great River of Oroonoque; Having been cast on Shore by Shipwreck, wherein all the Men perished but himself. With An Account how he was at last as strangely deliver'd by Pyrates. Written by Himself."_, which pretty much sums up the entire book.

## Jonathan Swift

Jonathan Swift (1667 -- 1745) was an Anglo-Irish writer, satirist, and Anglican[^anglicanism] cleric, who lived during the Georgian era (1714 -- c. 1830). His most known works are all satires, leading to many critics granting him the title of _the greatest satirist of the Georgian era_.

[^anglicanism]: Anglicanism (or Episcopalianism) is a Protestant denomination started by the Church of England, after the English Reformation, in the broader context of the Protestant Reformation across Europe. 

### Political activity

Swift frequently wrote about the political issues of his time and acted as a voice for the difficulties of living faced by the Irish people.

### _A Modest Proposal_

Published in the year 1729, under the full name: _"A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen to Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick"_, is a Juvenalian[^juvenalian] satire written by Jonathan Swift. The satire's shock factor is immense and instant, having lead to a backlash from an important number of the Georgian elite of Swift's time.

Structured as an essay, _A Modest Proposal_ claims to provide a simple and efficient solution for the social and economic troubles faced by poor people in Ireland, fattening their babies to sell them as "delicious" food for the rich. The essay uses the characteristic inconsiderate and cold language one may find in a typical report of the time, along with vocabulary commonly used to refer to cattle and other live stock, with harsh criticism of the immorality of the upper class.

| _"I do therefore humbly offer it to publick consideration, that of the hundred and twenty thousand children already computed, twenty thousand may be reserved for breed, whereof only one fourth part to be males; which is more than we allow to sheep, black cattle, or swine; and my reason is, that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage, a circumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore one male will be sufficient to serve four females. That the remaining hundred thousand may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the persons of quality and fortune through the kingdom; always advising the mother to let them suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render them plump, and fat for a good table."_
|
| _"I grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for landlords, who, as they have already devoured most of the parents, seem to have the best title to the children."_


[^juvenalian]: Satire inspired or under the model of Roman satirist Juvenal (~1st c. AD), who heavily utilized exaggeration and parody in order to create monstrous and incompetent renditions of the public figures and institutions he targeted.
