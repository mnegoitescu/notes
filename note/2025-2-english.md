**WORK IN PROGRESS**

# Introduction

Early Modern English literature represents the building block of most of the practices that we can find today in modern English literature, from the literary devices to themes, philosophical views, and even character tropes. This document serves as a quick glance over the twists and turns taken throughout history that have lead to the creation of the modern English novel, poetry, and literature as a whole. 

## John Milton

John Milton (1608 -- 1674) is one of the most substantial figures in the creation of modern English poetry.

### _Paradise Lost_

_Paradise Lost_ is an epic poem in blank verse[^blank] written by John Milton and publised in the year 1667. The work was originally divided into ten books, with later revisions being arranged in twelve books, as in Virgil's Aeneid, to more closely represent the model of classical epic poems. 

The poem is considered to be Milton's **magnum opus**, leading to his classification as of one of the greatest poets of English literature, commonly compared to the likes of Shakespeare. It tells the well-known Christian biblical narrative of the book of Genesis and the story of the Fall of Man: the temptation of Adam and Eve by Satan and subsequent knowledge of good and bad, and their expulsion from the Garden of Eden.

#### Major Themes

The poem features many Biblical themes, retelling the story of Genesis, the first book of the Bible. In his own words, Milton wrote the poem to _"justify the wayes of God to men"_, serving as a means for describing his views on two important elements of Christian theology: human free will, and the origin of evil.

The primary theological idea debated in _Paradise Lost_ is the nature of free will, in regards to two contrasting views common of his time: the Calvinist doctrine, that denied the existence of humanity's free will in concordance with Calvin's view on predestination[^predestination], and the humanist view that centers on the freedom of the will.

In Milton's view, denying the existance of man's freedom of choice turns man into a slave of his own reactions and decisions as one can deny any moral responsibility of his actions. However, if one assumes that free will does exist, they take full responsibility of their actions. It is under this framework that the poem describes the origin and nature of evil as the consequence of man's free will, and not the responsibility of God:

| _"I made him just and right,_  
| _Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall._  
| _Such I created all th'Ethereal Powers_  
| _And Spirits, both them who stood and them who failed;_  
| _Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell"_  
<sup>_(Book III, 98 -- 102)_</sup> 

#### Construction

_Paradise Lost_ features many of the literary techniques common in the works characteristic of Ancient Roman and Greek society, adapting the format of the epic poem to Christian morality and ideas. One such example can be seen in the opening of the poem, where the traditional poetic device of invocation is used. Instead of invoking the muses as is done in traditional epics, Milton adresses God as his _"Heav'nly Muse"_.

Another important poetic device used by Milton is _personification_, giving something that isn't living or a person human traits, such as emotions and a gender. We can observe this in Book 6, describing the fall of Satan and his army into Hell, after being chased away by Jesus Christ on a flaming chariot:

| _"Yet half his strength he put not forth, but checked_  
| _His thunder in mid volley; for he meant_  
| _Not to destroy, but root them out of Heaven:_  
| _The overthrown he raised, and as a herd_  
| _Of goats or timorous flock together thronged_  
| _Drove them before him thunder-struck, pursued_  
| _With terrours, and with furies, to the bounds_  
| _And crystal wall of Heaven; which, opening wide,_  
| _Rolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed_  
| _Into the wasteful deep: The monstrous sight_  
| _Struck them with horrour backward, but far worse_  
| _Urged them behind: Headlong themselves they threw_  
| _Down from the verge of Heaven; eternal wrath_  
| _Burnt after them to the bottomless pit._  
| _Hell heard the unsufferable noise, Hell saw_  
| _Heaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled_  
| _Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep_  
| _Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound._  
| _Nine days they fell: Confounded Chaos roared,_  
| _And felt tenfold confusion in their fall_  
| _Through his wild anarchy, so huge a rout_  
| _Incumbered him with ruin: Hell at last_  
| _Yawning received them whole, and on them closed;_  
| _Hell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire_  
| _Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain."_

Hell, despite being a place, is described as a _she_, and is frightened at the sight of Satan's fall: _"[...] Hell saw Heaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled affrighted, but strict Fate had cast too deep her dark foundations [...]"_.

[^blank]: Keeping meter between lines but not rhyming them.
[^predestination]: Predestination is a Calvinist doctrine that teaches that man's fate is already decided by God, whereby human free will is seen as contrary to God's divine plan.


## Daniel Defoe

Daniel Defoe (1660 -- 1731) was an English writer, merchant, and spy for both the Whigs and the Tories[^whigs]. His work was diverse and dynamic, from being an inventor and a bankrupt, to working as a politician, a businessman, and in journaling. His literary carreer was quite strong, having written over 250 works on a multitude of topics.

Despite being an extremely prolific writter, Defoe started his novel writing later in his life, having written his first novel, _Robinson Crusoe_, in his late fifties. Nevertheless, Defoe is best known for his novels, and is considered by many critics as _the inventor of the modern English novel_, since he was the first major English novelist to break away from the traditional formulas of literature (romances, epics, legends, allegories, and others), instead opting to write using real events as his inspiration, combining fiction with reality.

One such example of his blending of fiction and reality can be found in his first novel, which was most likely inspired by the many cases of real-life castaways, particularly the case of a Scottish sailor named [Alexander Selkirk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Selkirk), who was stranded for four years on an uninhabited island, named Robinson Crusoe Island since 1966, close to the Chilean coast.

[^whigs]: The Whigs and the Tories were two rivaling political parties in Britain between the 17th and 19th centuries.

### _Robinson Crusoe_

The first novel written by Daniel Defoe is _Robinson Crusoe_[^longtitle], published on the 25th of April 1719. It enjoyed almost immediate success and was greatly appreciated by readers for the story's verosimilitude (convincing rendition of reality) and captivating adventures. Defoe immediately followed the novel with two sequels, _The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe_, the same year, and _Serious Reflections During the Life and Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe: With his Vision of the Angelick World"_. The novel was so successful its first volume went through four editions by the end of the year, and was translated into a great number of languages (including smaller languages such as Coptic and Maltese). In fact, its legacy was so strong that the term "Robinsonade" was choosen to refer to the genre of adventure-focused stories that followed the model of _Robinson Crusoe_.

One of the novel's particularities and a characteristic feature of Daniel Defoe's novel writing, is the autobiographical narrative and usage of the story as a means to conceal a moral message. 

[^longtitle]: Or, under its full title: _"The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, of York, Mariner: Who lived Eight and Twenty Years, all alone in an un-inhabited Island on the Coast of America, near the Mouth of the Great River of Oroonoque; Having been cast on Shore by Shipwreck, wherein all the Men perished but himself. With An Account how he was at last as strangely deliver'd by Pyrates. Written by Himself."_, which pretty much sums up the entire book.

## Jonathan Swift

Jonathan Swift (1667 -- 1745) was an Anglo-Irish writer, satirist, and Anglican[^anglicanism] cleric, who lived during the Georgian era (1714 -- c. 1830). His most known works are all satires, leading to many critics granting him the title of _the greatest satirist of the Georgian era_.

[^anglicanism]: Anglicanism (or Episcopalianism) is a Protestant denomination started by the Church of England, after the English Reformation, in the broader context of the Protestant Reformation across Europe. 

### Political activity

Swift frequently wrote about the political issues of his time and acted as a voice for the difficulties of living faced by the Irish people.

### _A Modest Proposal_

Published in the year 1729, under the full name: _"A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen to Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick"_, is a Juvenalian[^juvenalian] satire written by Jonathan Swift. The satire's shock factor is immense and instant, having lead to a backlash from an important number of the Georgian elite of Swift's time.

Structured as an essay, _A Modest Proposal_ claims to provide a simple and efficient solution for the social and economic troubles faced by poor people in Ireland: fattening their babies to sell them as "delicious" food for the rich. The essay uses the characteristic inconsiderate and cold language one may find in a typical report of the time, along with vocabulary commonly used to refer to cattle and other live stock, with harsh criticism of the immorality of the upper class.

| _"I do therefore humbly offer it to publick consideration, that of the hundred and twenty thousand children already computed, twenty thousand may be reserved for breed, whereof only one fourth part to be males; which is more than we allow to sheep, black cattle, or swine; and my reason is, that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage, a circumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore one male will be sufficient to serve four females. That the remaining hundred thousand may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the persons of quality and fortune through the kingdom; always advising the mother to let them suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render them plump, and fat for a good table."_
|
| _"I grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for landlords, who, as they have already devoured most of the parents, seem to have the best title to the children."_


[^juvenalian]: Satire inspired or under the model of Roman satirist Juvenal (~1st c. AD), who heavily utilized exaggeration and parody in order to create monstrous and incompetent renditions of the public figures and institutions he targeted.

### _Gulliver's Travels_

_Gulliver's Travels_ is Swift's most popular and appreciated work, published on published the 28th of October, 1726, under the original title: _"Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World. In Four Parts. By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain of Several Ships"_. The work serves both as an astounding piece of literature read and enjoyed by all ages, as well as a witful critique of human nature and the Robinsonade literary genre, popularised by Daniel Defoe's _Robinson Crusoe_.

The novel tells the story of Lemuel Gulliver's travels across a wide range of fictional as well as real places: Lilliput (an island inhabited by tiny people), Brobdingnag (an island where everything, including the people, is huge), Laputa, Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Glubbdubdrib, Japan, and the Land of the Houyhnhnms. Each location that Gulliver visits parodies a type of human flaw, while also making fun of the usually exaggerated and nonsensical travels that had become popular in "traveller's tales" literature. In Swift's own words, he wrote _Gulliver's Travels_ _"to vex the world rather than divert it"_.

The novel's cultural influence is quite considerable. The term _Lilliputian_ has entered many languages as an adjective for describing anything miniature or delicate; likewise, the term _Brobdingnagian_ is included in the Oxford English Dictionary to describe anything gigantesque.

## Laurence Sterne

Laurence Sterne (1713 -- 1768) was also an Anglo-Irish novelist and Anglican cleric, and the son of an officer in the army. His most popular work is the comic novel _Tristram Shandy_.

### _The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman_

_The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman_ is a comic novel written by Laurence Sterne and published in nine volumes, from 1759 to 1767. The novel stood out due and rose to an immediate popularity due to its peculiar and almost cynical style of humour, as well as its whimsical, almost ludic plot and dialogue.
