# notes
notes for my studies and others, powered by [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

## structure
All notes are stored in the `note/` directory. The notes are organized through their filenames like so: `YR-SEM-TOPIC`

Where:

- `YR` is the year
- `SEM` is the semester
- `TOPIC` is the subject/topic of the note

For example, `2024-1-romana.md` is the note for my first semester of Old Romanian Literature class in 2024.

You can access a HTML directory of all the notes [here](https://negoitescu.xyz/notes) or by running a local HTTP server, using Python:

```
$ python3 -m http.server
```
