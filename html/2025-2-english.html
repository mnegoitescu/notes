<p><strong>WORK IN PROGRESS</strong></p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Early Modern English literature represents the building block of most
of the practices that we can find today in modern English literature,
from the literary devices to themes, philosophical views, and even
character tropes. This document serves as a quick glance over the twists
and turns taken throughout history that have lead to the creation of the
modern English novel, poetry, and literature as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="john-milton">John Milton</h2>
<p>John Milton (1608 – 1674) is one of the most substantial figures in
the creation of modern English poetry.</p>
<h3 id="paradise-lost"><em>Paradise Lost</em></h3>
<p><em>Paradise Lost</em> is an epic poem in blank verse<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
written by John Milton and publised in the year 1667. The work was
originally divided into ten books, with later revisions being arranged
in twelve books, as in Virgil’s Aeneid, to more closely represent the
model of classical epic poems.</p>
<p>The poem is considered to be Milton’s <strong>magnum opus</strong>,
leading to his classification as of one of the greatest poets of English
literature, commonly compared to the likes of Shakespeare. It tells the
well-known Christian biblical narrative of the book of Genesis and the
story of the Fall of Man: the temptation of Adam and Eve by Satan and
subsequent knowledge of good and bad, and their expulsion from the
Garden of Eden.</p>
<h4 id="major-themes">Major Themes</h4>
<p>The poem features many Biblical themes, retelling the story of
Genesis, the first book of the Bible. In his own words, Milton wrote the
poem to <em>“justify the wayes of God to men”</em>, serving as a means
for describing his views on two important elements of Christian
theology: human free will, and the origin of evil.</p>
<p>The primary theological idea debated in <em>Paradise Lost</em> is the
nature of free will, in regards to two contrasting views common of his
time: the Calvinist doctrine, that denied the existence of humanity’s
free will in concordance with Calvin’s view on predestination<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, and the humanist view that centers
on the freedom of the will.</p>
<p>In Milton’s view, denying the existance of man’s freedom of choice
turns man into a slave of his own reactions and decisions as one can
deny any moral responsibility of his actions. However, if one assumes
that free will does exist, they take full responsibility of their
actions. It is under this framework that the poem describes the origin
and nature of evil as the consequence of man’s free will, and not the
responsibility of God:</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>“I made him just and right,</em><br />
<em>Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.</em><br />
<em>Such I created all th’Ethereal Powers</em><br />
<em>And Spirits, both them who stood and them who failed;</em><br />
<em>Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell”</em></div>
<p><sup><em>(Book III, 98 – 102)</em></sup></p>
<h4 id="construction">Construction</h4>
<p><em>Paradise Lost</em> features many of the literary techniques
common in the works characteristic of Ancient Roman and Greek society,
adapting the format of the epic poem to Christian morality and ideas.
One such example can be seen in the opening of the poem, where the
traditional poetic device of invocation is used. Instead of invoking the
muses as is done in traditional epics, Milton adresses God as his
<em>“Heav’nly Muse”</em>.</p>
<p>Another important poetic device used by Milton is
<em>personification</em>, giving something that isn’t living or a person
human traits, such as emotions and a gender. We can observe this in Book
6, describing the fall of Satan and his army into Hell, after being
chased away by Jesus Christ on a flaming chariot:</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>“Yet half his strength he put not forth, but
checked</em><br />
<em>His thunder in mid volley; for he meant</em><br />
<em>Not to destroy, but root them out of Heaven:</em><br />
<em>The overthrown he raised, and as a herd</em><br />
<em>Of goats or timorous flock together thronged</em><br />
<em>Drove them before him thunder-struck, pursued</em><br />
<em>With terrours, and with furies, to the bounds</em><br />
<em>And crystal wall of Heaven; which, opening wide,</em><br />
<em>Rolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed</em><br />
<em>Into the wasteful deep: The monstrous sight</em><br />
<em>Struck them with horrour backward, but far worse</em><br />
<em>Urged them behind: Headlong themselves they threw</em><br />
<em>Down from the verge of Heaven; eternal wrath</em><br />
<em>Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.</em><br />
<em>Hell heard the unsufferable noise, Hell saw</em><br />
<em>Heaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled</em><br />
<em>Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep</em><br />
<em>Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.</em><br />
<em>Nine days they fell: Confounded Chaos roared,</em><br />
<em>And felt tenfold confusion in their fall</em><br />
<em>Through his wild anarchy, so huge a rout</em><br />
<em>Incumbered him with ruin: Hell at last</em><br />
<em>Yawning received them whole, and on them closed;</em><br />
<em>Hell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire</em><br />
<em>Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain.”</em></div>
<p>Hell, despite being a place, is described as a <em>she</em>, and is
frightened at the sight of Satan’s fall: <em>“[…] Hell saw Heaven
ruining from Heaven, and would have fled affrighted, but strict Fate had
cast too deep her dark foundations […]”</em>.</p>
<h2 id="daniel-defoe">Daniel Defoe</h2>
<p>Daniel Defoe (1660 – 1731) was an English writer, merchant, and spy
for both the Whigs and the Tories<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. His work was diverse
and dynamic, from being an inventor and a bankrupt, to working as a
politician, a businessman, and in journaling. His literary carreer was
quite strong, having written over 250 works on a multitude of
topics.</p>
<p>Despite being an extremely prolific writter, Defoe started his novel
writing later in his life, having written his first novel, <em>Robinson
Crusoe</em>, in his late fifties. Nevertheless, Defoe is best known for
his novels, and is considered by many critics as <em>the inventor of the
modern English novel</em>, since he was the first major English novelist
to break away from the traditional formulas of literature (romances,
epics, legends, allegories, and others), instead opting to write using
real events as his inspiration, combining fiction with reality.</p>
<p>One such example of his blending of fiction and reality can be found
in his first novel, which was most likely inspired by the many cases of
real-life castaways, particularly the case of a Scottish sailor named <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Selkirk">Alexander
Selkirk</a>, who was stranded for four years on an uninhabited island,
named Robinson Crusoe Island since 1966, close to the Chilean coast.</p>
<h3 id="robinson-crusoe"><em>Robinson Crusoe</em></h3>
<p>The first novel written by Daniel Defoe is <em>Robinson Crusoe</em><a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, published on the 25th of April
1719. It enjoyed almost immediate success and was greatly appreciated by
readers for the story’s verosimilitude (convincing rendition of reality)
and captivating adventures. Defoe immediately followed the novel with
two sequels, <em>The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe</em>, the
same year, and <em>Serious Reflections During the Life and Surprising
Adventures of Robinson Crusoe: With his Vision of the Angelick
World”</em>. The novel was so successful its first volume went through
four editions by the end of the year, and was translated into a great
number of languages (including smaller languages such as Coptic and
Maltese). In fact, its legacy was so strong that the term “Robinsonade”
was choosen to refer to the genre of adventure-focused stories that
followed the model of <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>.</p>
<p>One of the novel’s particularities and a characteristic feature of
Daniel Defoe’s novel writing, is the autobiographical narrative and
usage of the story as a means to conceal a moral message.</p>
<h2 id="jonathan-swift">Jonathan Swift</h2>
<p>Jonathan Swift (1667 – 1745) was an Anglo-Irish writer, satirist, and
Anglican<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> cleric, who lived during the
Georgian era (1714 – c. 1830). His most known works are all satires,
leading to many critics granting him the title of <em>the greatest
satirist of the Georgian era</em>.</p>
<h3 id="political-activity">Political activity</h3>
<p>Swift frequently wrote about the political issues of his time and
acted as a voice for the difficulties of living faced by the Irish
people.</p>
<h3 id="a-modest-proposal"><em>A Modest Proposal</em></h3>
<p>Published in the year 1729, under the full name: <em>“A Modest
Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen
to Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the
Publick”</em>, is a Juvenalian<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> satire written by
Jonathan Swift. The satire’s shock factor is immense and instant, having
lead to a backlash from an important number of the Georgian elite of
Swift’s time.</p>
<p>Structured as an essay, <em>A Modest Proposal</em> claims to provide
a simple and efficient solution for the social and economic troubles
faced by poor people in Ireland: fattening their babies to sell them as
“delicious” food for the rich. The essay uses the characteristic
inconsiderate and cold language one may find in a typical report of the
time, along with vocabulary commonly used to refer to cattle and other
live stock, with harsh criticism of the immorality of the upper
class.</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>“I do therefore humbly offer it to publick
consideration, that of the hundred and twenty thousand children already
computed, twenty thousand may be reserved for breed, whereof only one
fourth part to be males; which is more than we allow to sheep, black
cattle, or swine; and my reason is, that these children are seldom the
fruits of marriage, a circumstance not much regarded by our savages,
therefore one male will be sufficient to serve four females. That the
remaining hundred thousand may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the
persons of quality and fortune through the kingdom; always advising the
mother to let them suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render
them plump, and fat for a good table.”</em><br />
<br />
<em>“I grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper
for landlords, who, as they have already devoured most of the parents,
seem to have the best title to the children.”</em></div>
<h3 id="gullivers-travels"><em>Gulliver’s Travels</em></h3>
<p><em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> is Swift’s most popular and appreciated
work, published on published the 28th of October, 1726, under the
original title: <em>“Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World.
In Four Parts. By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain
of Several Ships”</em>. The work serves both as an astounding piece of
literature read and enjoyed by all ages, as well as a witful critique of
human nature and the Robinsonade literary genre, popularised by Daniel
Defoe’s <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>.</p>
<p>The novel tells the story of Lemuel Gulliver’s travels across a wide
range of fictional as well as real places: Lilliput (an island inhabited
by tiny people), Brobdingnag (an island where everything, including the
people, is huge), Laputa, Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Glubbdubdrib, Japan, and
the Land of the Houyhnhnms. Each location that Gulliver visits parodies
a type of human flaw, while also making fun of the usually exaggerated
and nonsensical travels that had become popular in “traveller’s tales”
literature. In Swift’s own words, he wrote <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em>
<em>“to vex the world rather than divert it”</em>.</p>
<p>The novel’s cultural influence is quite considerable. The term
<em>Lilliputian</em> has entered many languages as an adjective for
describing anything miniature or delicate; likewise, the term
<em>Brobdingnagian</em> is included in the Oxford English Dictionary to
describe anything gigantesque.</p>
<h2 id="laurence-sterne">Laurence Sterne</h2>
<p>Laurence Sterne (1713 – 1768) was also an Anglo-Irish novelist and
Anglican cleric, and the son of an officer in the army. His most popular
work is the comic novel <em>Tristram Shandy</em>.</p>
<h3 id="the-life-and-opinions-of-tristram-shandy-gentleman"><em>The Life
and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman</em></h3>
<p><em>The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman</em> is a
comic novel written by Laurence Sterne and published in nine volumes,
from 1759 to 1767. The novel stood out due and rose to an immediate
popularity due to its peculiar and almost cynical style of humour, as
well as its whimsical, almost ludic plot and dialogue.</p>
