<p><strong>WORK IN PROGRESS</strong></p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Early Modern English literature represents the building block of most
of the practices that we can find today in modern English literature,
from the literary devices to themes, philosophical views, and even
character tropes. This document serves as a quick glance over the twists
and turns taken throughout history that have lead to the creation of the
modern English novel, poetry, and literature as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="john-milton">John Milton</h2>
<p>John Milton (1608 – 1674) is one of the most substantial figures in
the creation of modern English poetry.</p>
<h3 id="paradise-lost"><em>Paradise Lost</em></h3>
<p><em>Paradise Lost</em> is an epic poem in blank verse<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
written by John Milton (1608 – 1674) and publised in the year 1667. The
work was originally divided into ten books, with later revisions being
arranged in twelve books, as in Virgil’s Aeneid, to more closely
represent the model of classical epic poems.</p>
<p>The poem is considered to be Milton’s <strong>magnum opus</strong>,
leading to his classification as of one of the greatest poets of English
literature, commonly compared to the likes of Shakespeare. It tells the
well-known Christian biblical narrative of the book of Genesis and the
story of the fall of man: the temptation of Adam and Eve by Satan and
subsequent knowledge of good and bad, and their expulsion from the
Garden of Eden.</p>
<h4 id="plot-and-characters">Plot and Characters</h4>
<h4 id="major-themes">Major Themes</h4>
<p>Christian and Biblical themes are abundant throughout the poem, given
its plot, as well as themes related to theology, such as free will,
predestination, and redemption.</p>
<h2 id="daniel-defoe">Daniel Defoe</h2>
<p>Daniel Defoe (1660 – 1731) was an English writer, merchant, and spy
for both the Whigs and the Tories<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. His work was diverse
and dynamic, from being an inventor and a bankrupt, to working as a
politician, a businessman, and in journaling. His literary carreer was
quite strong, having written over 250 works on a multitude of
topics.</p>
<p>Despite being an extremely prolific writter, Defoe started his novel
writing later in his life, having written his first novel, <em>Robinson
Crusoe</em>, in his late fifties. Nevertheless, Defoe is best known for
his novels, and is considered by many critics as <em>the inventor of the
modern English novel</em>, since he was the first major English novelist
to break away from the traditional formulas of literature (romances,
epics, legends, allegories, and others), instead opting to write using
real events as his inspiration, combining fiction with reality.</p>
<p>One such example of his blending of fiction and reality can be found
in his first novel, which was most likely inspired by the many cases of
real-life castaways, particularly the case of a Scottish sailor named <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Selkirk">Alexander
Selkirk</a>, who was stranded for four years on an uninhabited island,
named Robinson Crusoe Island since 1966, close to the Chilean coast.</p>
<h3 id="robinson-crusoe"><em>Robinson Crusoe</em></h3>
<p>The first novel written by Daniel Defoe is <em>Robinson Crusoe</em><a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, published on the 25th of April
1719. It enjoyed almost immediate success and was greatly appreciated by
readers for the story’s verosimilitude (convincing rendition of reality)
and captivating adventures. Defoe immediately followed the novel with
two sequels, <em>The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe</em>, the
same year, and <em>Serious Reflections During the Life and Surprising
Adventures of Robinson Crusoe: With his Vision of the Angelick
World”</em>. The novel was so successful its first volume went through
four editions by the end of the year, and was translated into a great
number of languages (including smaller languages such as Coptic and
Maltese). In fact, its legacy was so strong that the term “Robinsonade”
was choosen to refer to the genre of adventure-focused stories that
followed the model of <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>.</p>
<p>One of the novel’s particularities and a characteristic feature of
Daniel Defoe’s novel writing, is the autobiographical narrative and
usage of the story as a means to conceal a moral message.</p>
<h2 id="jonathan-swift">Jonathan Swift</h2>
<p>Jonathan Swift (1667 – 1745) was an Anglo-Irish writer, satirist, and
Anglican<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> cleric, who lived during the
Georgian era (1714 – c. 1830). His most known works are all satires,
leading to many critics granting him the title of <em>the greatest
satirist of the Georgian era</em>.</p>
<h3 id="political-activity">Political activity</h3>
<p>Swift frequently wrote about the political issues of his time and
acted as a voice for the difficulties of living faced by the Irish
people.</p>
<h3 id="a-modest-proposal"><em>A Modest Proposal</em></h3>
<p>Published in the year 1729, under the full name: <em>“A Modest
Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burthen
to Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the
Publick”</em>, is a Juvenalian<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> satire written by
Jonathan Swift. The satire’s shock factor is immense and instant, having
lead to a backlash from an important number of the Georgian elite of
Swift’s time.</p>
<p>Structured as an essay, <em>A Modest Proposal</em> claims to provide
a simple and efficient solution for the social and economic troubles
faced by poor people in Ireland, fattening their babies to sell them as
“delicious” food for the rich. The essay uses the characteristic
inconsiderate and cold language one may find in a typical report of the
time, along with vocabulary commonly used to refer to cattle and other
live stock, with harsh criticism of the immorality of the upper
class.</p>
<div class="line-block"><em>“I do therefore humbly offer it to publick
consideration, that of the hundred and twenty thousand children already
computed, twenty thousand may be reserved for breed, whereof only one
fourth part to be males; which is more than we allow to sheep, black
cattle, or swine; and my reason is, that these children are seldom the
fruits of marriage, a circumstance not much regarded by our savages,
therefore one male will be sufficient to serve four females. That the
remaining hundred thousand may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the
persons of quality and fortune through the kingdom; always advising the
mother to let them suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render
them plump, and fat for a good table.”</em><br />
<br />
<em>“I grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper
for landlords, who, as they have already devoured most of the parents,
seem to have the best title to the children.”</em></div>
