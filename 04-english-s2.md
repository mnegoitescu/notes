## Introduction

## John Milton

John Milton is one of the most substantial figures in the creation of modern English poetry

### Biography

### _Paradise Lost_

_Paradise Lost_ is an epic poem in blank verse[^blank] written by John Milton and publised in the year 1667. The work was originally divided into ten books, with later revisions being arranged in twelve books, as in Virgil's Aeneid, to more closely represent the model of classical epic poems. 

The poem is considered to be Milton's **magnum opus**, leading to his classification as of one of the greatest poets of English literature, commonly compared to the likes of Shakespeare. It tells the well-known Christian biblical narrative of the book of Genesis and the story of the fall of man: the temptation of Adam and Eve and subsequent knowledge of good and bad, and their expulsion from the Garden of Eden due to their sin.
